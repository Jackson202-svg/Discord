Discord is a free communication platform for voice, video, and text chat, created for gamers but now used by communities of all kinds to connect online. Users can create profiles and join or create "servers" (communities) organized by topic, which are further divided into text or voice channels. It is available on a wide range of devices, including desktops, mobiles, web browsers, and some gaming consoles.
